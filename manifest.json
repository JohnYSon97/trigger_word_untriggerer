    "description": "As our society becomes more and more aware of the different issues that individuals have, it brings light to 
     certain sensitive words or phrases, known as trigger words or phrases, may bring back negative experiences or feelings towards 
     a past experiecne or feelings. Thus, this extension hopes to nullify the bad sentiments and feelings that come with those words 
     or phrases by replacing them with the nonsense words from the popular television show 'Rick and Morty.' In doing so, we are not
     promoting a lessened freedom or speech or the running away from problems or even censorship at all, in fact we are promoting the 
     exact opposite. By allowing these words to still be present, just not in their emotion inducing, sensitive state, conversation 
     and discussion can be opened about these sensitive or taboo topics in an environment that is safe and comfortable for all
     participants. Currently, we only have functionality for 'un-triggering' the word 'rape' and it's variations but we will soon add
     in the functionality of being able to add and modify words that one would want 'un-triggered.' Enjoy!",
